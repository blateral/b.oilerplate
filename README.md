# Launcher
Yet another Node.js and GruntJS boilerplate, which features cool tasks like

* compiling your SASS/SCSS through grunt-sass (yeah, the libsass thingy)
* autoprefixes your CSS
* hinting, concat and uglifying your javascript
* building html files with assemble.io and handlebars template
* you name it

This boilerplate is my personal project kick-off tool and I use it very often. It's only taylored to fit *my* needs. Feel free to use it, but beware, there might be better ones out there...

2. Run `bower install` from your project root directory

## Developing
1. Run `grunt`
